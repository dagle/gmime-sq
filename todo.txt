Talk to upstream
	- Being able to set a path, for user to create a custom function
	- Maybe having a class like mime-kit?
	- Being able to set a policy instead of default

Missing flags (for now):
GMimeEncryptFlags;
GMIME_ENCRYPT_ALWAYS_TRUST  = 1, [ ] (This is policy? Lets not do this until customize the policy?)
GMIME_ENCRYPT_THROW_KEYIDS  = 64, [ ] (Lets not do this now or at all)

GMimeDecryptFlags;
GMIME_DECRYPT_ENABLE_KEYSERVER_LOOKUPS         = 1 << 15, [ ] (later)
GMIME_DECRYPT_ENABLE_ONLINE_CERTIFICATE_CHECKS = 1 << 15  [ ] (later)

GMimeVerifyFlags;
GMIME_VERIFY_ENABLE_KEYSERVER_LOOKUPS         = 1 << 15, [ ] (later)
GMIME_VERIFY_ENABLE_ONLINE_CERTIFICATE_CHECKS = 1 << 15  [ ] (later)
