Make test more "dynamic":
	- Test password and generate password-protected keys
	- Delete old keys and generate new keys for every test
	- Propper matching, not just emails addresses.
	- Make the subclasess only registered once
	- Make it useable from rust
	- Try to use it from lua
	- Fix the namespace (do not use galore)
	- General cleanup

Talk to upstream
	- Being able to set a path, for user to create a custom function
	- Maybe having a class like mime-kit?
	- Being able to set a policy instead of default
